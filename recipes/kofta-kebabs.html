    <h2>About This Dish</h2>
    <p>These kofta kebabs are made with ground lamb that's seasoned with garlic and six different kinds of spices, then molded onto skewers and cooked on the grill. They are very good! Serve with yogurt, flatbread, lettuce, tomato, and cucumber.</p>

    <p>Kofta Kebabs are one of my favorite recipes! They are a stable meal in Turkish and mediterranean culture. You are in for quite a treat, so I hope your hands, mouth and tummy are ready to enjoy what we have in store for you!</p>

    <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
    <p>The total cook time is 45 minutes</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pound of ground lamb</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of grated onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of fresh parsley</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon of ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        <li>28 bamboo skewers, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong>Cooking Steps</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong><p>Mash garlic into a paste with salt using a mortar and pestle or the flat side of a chef's knife on your cutting board.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong><p>Mix garlic into lamb with onion, parsley, coriander, cumin, cinnamon, allspice, cayenne pepper, ginger, and pepper in a mixing bowl until well blended.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong><p>Form mixture into 28 balls. Form each ball around the tip of a skewer, flattening it into a 2-inch oval; repeat with remaining skewers. Place kebabs onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 12 hours.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong><p>Cook skewers on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until browned and cooked through, about 5 to 6 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong><p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p></li>
    </ol>
