    <h2>About This Dish</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a very popular and traditional dish that is served through families and generations over time. It is also my favorite food. As a pasta and meat lover, the combination of pasta, meat, and rich cheeses is perfect. When I first consumed it, it was almost like magic and as if heaven erupted in my mouth.</p>

    <p>This is a special homemade lasagna recipe with made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but this recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
